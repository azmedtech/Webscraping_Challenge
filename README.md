# Webscraping_Challenge

## Project
In this web-scraping and data analysis project, you will strengthen your core skills: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and visually communicating your insights. 

## Project Tools

Using your knowledge about HTML elements and their attributes, extract information from websites about Mars via automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup.

## Project Structure
This project is divided into two parts:

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

-- Using Jupyter Notebook, perform the following:
    * Visit the website https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html
    * Scrape the appropriate elements
    * Store the results in a Python list
        * Use the keys "title" and "preview" to create your dictionaries
    * Export your data as a JSON file

Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

-- Using Jupyter Notebook, perform the following:
    * Visit the website https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html
    * Scrape the appropriate elements
    * Store the results in a Pandas DataFrame
        * Use the same column headings as the table on the website
    * Prepare the data for analysis
    * Analyze the data using Pandas functions
    * Create data visualizations to communicate your insights
    * Export your data as a CSV file


### Collaboration
* Code debugging: ASU Learning Assistants & Xpert Learning Assistant (AI) Tool
* For loop to store the data in a list of dictionaries, prior to conversion into a dataframe: Classmate NG
